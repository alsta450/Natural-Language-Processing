    "# 7. Extracting Information from Text\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For any given question, it's likely that someone has written the answer down somewhere. The amount of natural language text that is available in electronic form is truly staggering, and is increasing every day. However, the complexity of natural language can make it very difficult to access the information in that text. The state of the art in NLP is still a long way from being able to build general-purpose representations of meaning from unrestricted text. If we instead focus our efforts on a limited set of questions or \"entity relations,\" such as \"where are different facilities located,\" or \"who is employed by what company,\" we can make significant progress. The goal of this chapter is to answer the following questions:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1.    How can we build a system that extracts structured data, such as tables, from unstructured text?\r\n",
    "2.    What are some robust methods for identifying the entities and relationships described in a text?\r\n",
    "3.    Which corpora are appropriate for this work, and how do we use them for training and evaluating our models?\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Along the way, we'll apply techniques from the last two chapters to the problems of chunking and named-entity recognition.\r\n"

Next, each sentence is tagged with part-of-speech tags, which will prove very helpful in the next step, **named entity detection**. In this step, we search for mentions of potentially interesting entities in each sentence. Finally, we use **relation detection** to search for likely relations between different entities in the text.\n",

    "### 2.1   Noun Phrase Chunking\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by considering the task of **noun phrase chunking**, or **NP-chunking**, where we search for chunks corresponding to individual noun phrases. For example, here is some Wall Street Journal text with `NP`-chunks marked using brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    (2) [ The/DT market/NN ] for/IN [ system-management/NN software/NN ] for/IN \n",
    "        [  Digital/NNP ] [ 's/POS hardware/NN ] is/VBZ fragmented/JJ enough/RB that/IN \n",

    "          well/RB there/RB ./.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, `NP`-chunks are often smaller pieces than complete noun phrases. For example, *the market for system-management software for Digital's hardware* is a single noun phrase (containing two nested noun phrases), but it is captured in `NP`-chunks by the simpler chunk *the market*. One of the motivations for this difference is that `NP`-chunks are defined so as not to contain other `NP`-chunks. Consequently, any prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses that modify a nominal will not be included in the corresponding `NP`-chunk, since they almost certainly contain further noun phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most useful sources of information for `NP`-chunking is part-of-speech tags. This is one of the motivations for performing part-of-speech tagging in our information extraction system. We demonstrate this approach using an example sentence that has been part-of-speech tagged in the following code. In order to create an `NP`-chunker, we will first define a **chunk grammar**, consisting of rules that indicate how sentences should be chunked. In this case, we will define a simple grammar with a single regular-expression rule. This rule says that an NP chunk should be formed whenever the chunker finds an optional determiner (`DT`) followed by any number of adjectives (`JJ`) and then a noun (`NN`). Using this grammar, we create a chunk parser, and test it on our example sentence. The result is a tree, which we can either print, or display graphically."

    "As befits their intermediate status between tagging and parsing (Chapter 8), chunk structures can be represented using either tags or trees. The most widespread file representation uses **IOB tags**. In this scheme, each token is tagged with one of three special chunk tags, `I` (inside), `O` (outside), or `B` (begin). A token is tagged as `B` if it marks the beginning of a chunk. Subsequent tokens within the chunk are tagged `I`. All other tokens are tagged `O`. The `B` and `I` tags are suffixed with the chunk type, e.g. `B-NP`, `I-NP`. Of course, it is not necessary to specify a chunk type for tokens that appear outside a chunk, so these are just labeled `O`. \r\n",

    "Both the regular-expression based chunkers and the n-gram chunkers decide what chunks to create entirely based on part-of-speech tags. However, sometimes part-of-speech tags are insufficient to determine how a sentence should be chunked. For example, consider the following two statements:\r\n",

In the first sentence, *the farmer* and *rice* are separate chunks, while the corresponding material in the second sentence, *the computer monitor*, is a single chunk. Clearly, we need to make use of information about the content of the words, in addition to just their part-of-speech tags, if we wish to maximize chunking performance.\r\n",

Like the n-gram chunker considered in the previous section, this classifier-based chunker will work by assigning IOB tags to the words in a sentence, and then converting those tags to chunks. For the classifier-based tagger itself, we will use the same approach that we used in Chapter 6 to build a part-of-speech tagger.\r\n",

    "The basic code for the classifier-based NP chunker is shown below. It consists of two classes. The first class is almost identical to the `ConsecutivePosTagger` class from Chapter 6. The only two differences are that it calls a different feature extractor and that it uses a MaxentClassifier rather than a NaiveBayesClassifier. The second class is basically a wrapper around the tagger class that turns it into a chunker. During training, this second class maps the chunk trees in the training corpus into tag sequences; in the `parse()` method, it converts the tag sequence provided by the tagger back into a chunk tree."

The following table lists some of the more commonly used types of NEs.

    "The goal of a **named entity recognition** (NER) system is to identify all textual mentions of the named entities. This can be broken down into two sub-tasks: identifying the boundaries of the NE, and identifying its type. While named entity recognition is frequently a prelude to identifying relations in Information Extraction, it can also contribute to other tasks. For example, in Question Answering (QA), we try to improve the precision of Information Retrieval by recovering not whole pages, but just those parts which contain an answer to the user's question. Most QA systems take the documents returned by standard Information Retrieval, and then attempt to isolate the minimal text snippet in the document containing the answer. Now suppose the question was *Who was the first President of the US?*, and one of the documents that was retrieved contained the following passage:\n",
    "\n",
    "(5)\n",
    ">The Washington Monument is the most prominent structure in Washington, D.C. and one of the city's early attractions. It was built in honor of George Washington, who led the country to independence and then became its first President.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of the question leads us to expect that an answer should be of the form *X was the first President of the US*, where *X* is not only a noun phrase, but also refers to a named entity of type PERSON. This should allow us to ignore the first sentence in the passage. While it contains two occurrences of *Washington*, named entity recognition should tell us that neither of them has the correct type.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we go about identifying named entities? One option would be to look up each word in an appropriate list of names. For example, in the case of locations, we could use a **gazetteer**, or geographical dictionary, such as the Alexandria Gazetteer or the Getty Gazetteer. However, doing this blindly runs into problems, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='images/locations.png' width='500' />\n",
    "\n",
    "*Location Detection by Simple Lookup for a News Story: Looking up every word in a gazetteer is error-prone; case distinctions may help, but these are not always present.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the gazetteer has good coverage of locations in many countries, and incorrectly finds locations like Sanchez in the Dominican Republic and On in Vietnam. Of course we could omit such locations from the gazetteer, but then we won't be able to identify them when they do appear in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets even harder in the case of names for people or organizations. Any list of such names will probably have poor coverage. New organizations come into existence every day, so if we are trying to deal with contemporary newswire or blog entries, it is unlikely that we will be able to recognize many of the entities using gazetteer lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another major source of difficulty is caused by the fact that many named entity terms are ambiguous. Thus *May* and *North* are likely to be parts of named entities for DATE and LOCATION, respectively, but could both be part of a PERSON; conversely *Christian Dior* looks like a PERSON but is more likely to be of type ORGANIZATION. A term like *Yankee* will be ordinary modifier in some contexts, but will be marked as an entity of type ORGANIZATION in the phrase *Yankee infielders*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further challenges are posed by multi-word names like *Stanford University*, and by names that contain other names such as *Cecil H. Green Library* and *Escondido Village Conference Service Center*. In named entity recognition, therefore, we need to be able to identify the beginning and end of multi-token sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition is a task that is well-suited to the type of classifier-based approach that we saw for noun phrase chunking. In particular, we can build a tagger that labels each word in a sentence using the IOB format, where chunks are labeled by their appropriate type. Here is part of the CONLL 2002 (`conll2002`) Dutch training data:\n",

    "In this representation, there is one token per line, each with its part-of-speech tag and its named entity tag. Based on this training corpus, we can construct a tagger that can be used to label new sentences; and use the `nltk.chunk.conlltags2tree()` function to convert the tag sequences into a chunk tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK provides a classifier that has already been trained to recognize named entities, accessed with the function `nltk.ne_chunk()`. If we set the parameter `binary=True`, then named entities are just tagged as `NE`; otherwise, the classifier adds category labels such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, and GPE."

    "\n",
    "Once named entities have been identified in a text, we then want to extract the relations that exist between them. As indicated earlier, we will typically be looking for relations between specified types of named entity. One way of approaching this task is to initially look for all triples of the form (*X*, α, *Y*), where *X* and *Y* are named entities of the required types, and α is the string of words that intervenes between *X* and *Y*. We can then use regular expressions to pull out just those instances of α that express the relation that we are looking for. The following example searches for strings that contain the word *in*. The special regular expression `(?!\\b.+ing\\b)` is a negative lookahead assertion that allows us to disregard strings such as *success in supervising the transition of*, where *in* is followed by a gerund."

    "-    Information extraction systems search large bodies of unrestricted text for specific types of entities and relations, and use them to populate well-organized databases. These databases can then be used to find answers for specific questions.\n",
    "-    The typical architecture for an information extraction system begins by segmenting, tokenizing, and part-of-speech tagging the text. The resulting data is then searched for specific types of entity. Finally, the information extraction system looks at entities that are mentioned near one another in the text, and tries to determine whether specific relationships hold between those entities.\n",
    "-    Entity recognition is often performed using chunkers, which segment multi-token sequences, and label them with the appropriate entity type. Common entity types include ORGANIZATION, PERSON, LOCATION, DATE, TIME, MONEY, and GPE (geo-political entity).\n",
    "-    Chunkers can be constructed using rule-based systems, such as the `RegexpParser` class provided by NLTK; or using machine learning techniques, such as the `ConsecutiveNPChunker` presented in this chapter. In either case, part-of-speech tags are often a very important feature when searching for chunks.\n",
    "-    Although chunkers are specialized to create relatively flat data structures, where no two chunks are allowed to overlap, they can be cascaded together to build nested structures.\n",
    "-    Relation extraction can be performed using either rule-based systems which typically look for specific patterns in the text that connect entities and the intervening words; or using machine-learning systems which typically attempt to learn such patterns automatically from a training corpus.\n",
